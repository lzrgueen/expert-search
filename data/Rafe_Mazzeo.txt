We give a detailed description of the Schwartz kernel of the resolvent of the Laplacian on a certain class of complete Riemannian manifolds with negative sectional curvature near infinity. These manifolds have compactifications as C∞ manifolds with boundary on which …

Examples of edge operators include Laplacians on asymptotically flat and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. Edge operators also arise in boundary problems around higher condimension boundaries. This paper is concerned with the analysis of general elliptic edge …

Let $ X $ be a compact manifold with boundary. Suppose that the boundary is fibred, $\phi:\pa X\longrightarrow Y, $ and let $ x\in\CI (X) $ be a boundary defining function. This data fixes the space offibred cusp'vector fields, consisting of those vector fields $ V $ on $ X …

This article considers the existence and regularity of Kahler-Einstein metrics on a compact Kahler manifold $ M $ with edge singularities with cone angle $2\pi\beta $ along a smooth divisor $ D $. We prove existence of such metrics with negative, zero and some positive …

Here, and throughout, we work with W°° maps and spaces. Let h be a Riemannian metric on the base space Y. Suppose that g^ e ^°°{M\ S2M) is a Ψ°° symmetric 2-cotensor on M which is positive definite on the fibers. In particular g^ induces a Riemannian structure on each …

We consider the asymptotic behaviour of positive solutions u of the conformal scalar curvature equation,, in the neighbourhood of isolated singularities in the standard Euclidean ball. Although asymptotic radial symmetry for such solutions was proved some time ago,[2] …

We study the space of $ L^ 2$ harmonic forms on complete manifolds with metrics of fibred boundary or fibred cusp type. These metrics generalize the geometric structures at infinity of several different well-known classes of metrics, including asymptotically locally Euclidean …

I. Introduction. In this note we derive Carleman estimates at infinity for the Laplace operator on certain Riemannian manifolds. These estimates are applied to prove a unique continuation theorem for the Laplacians on these manifolds and also for a class of second …

We construct a new class of complete constant mean curvature surfaces in R^ 3. These are geometrically different than the surfaces constructed by Kapouleas' gluing technique. These are obtained by piecing together half-Delaunay surfaces to the truncations of minimal k …

The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of weak solutions to the equation $\Delta u+ u^ p= 0$ which are positive in a domain $\Omega\subset {\Bbb R}^ N $, vanish at the boundary, and have prescribed isolated singularities. The exponent $ p $ is required to lie in …

Complete, conformally flat metrics of constant positive scalar curvature on the complement of $ k $ points in the $ n $-sphere, $ k\ge 2$, $ n\ge 3$, were constructed by R. Schoen in 1988. We consider the problem of determining the moduli space of all such metrics. All such …

We extend the results and methods of\cite {MP} to prove the existence of constant positive scalar curvature metrics $ g $ which are complete and conformal to the standard metric on $ S^ N\setminus\Lambda $, where $\Lambda $ is a disjoint union of submanifolds of …

1. Introduction. The classical Hodge theoremis a simple yet remarkable link between analysis and topology on an arbitrary compact Riemannian manifold. It has no analog on a general noncompact manifold, even if the manifold is assumed complete, for the …

We examine the space of finite topology surfaces in ℝ 3 which are complete, properly embedded and have nonzero constant mean curvature. These surfaces are noncompact provided we exclude the case of the round sphere. We prove that the space M k of all such …

Amongst the recent developments in the study of embedded complete minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces in R3 is the realization that these objects are far more exible than is apparent from their Weierstrass representations. Our aim in this paper is to prove agluing …

The singular Yamabe problem concerns the existence and nature of complete metrics with constant scalar curvature on the complement of a closed subset, assumed here to be a smooth submanifold, in a compact Riemannian manifold and which are conformal to a …

We give a general procedure for gluing together possibly noncompact manifolds of constant scalar curvature which satisfy an extra nondegeneracy hypothesis. Our aim is to provide a simple paradigm for making" analytic" connected sums. In particular, we can easily construct …

A basic problem has been to construct complete conformally flat metrics of constant positive scalar curvature on the complement of arbitrary sets Λ c Sn where Sn is an^-sphere. A necessary condition for the existence of such a metric is that the Hausdorff dimension of Λ …

Let $\Gamma $ be a nondegenerate geodesic in a compact Riemannian manifold $ M $. We prove the existence of a partial foliation of a neighbourhood of $\Gamma $ by CMC surfaces which are small perturbations of the geodesic tubes about $\Gamma $. There are gaps in …
