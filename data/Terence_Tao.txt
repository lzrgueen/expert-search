Suppose we are given a vector f in a class FsubeRopf N, eg, a class of digital signals or digital images. How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision epsi in the Euclidean (lscr 2) metric? This paper shows that if the¬†‚Ä¶

This paper considers a natural error correcting problem with real valued input/output. We wish to recover an input vector f/spl isin/R/sup n/from corrupted measurements y= Af+ e. Here, A is an m by n (coding) matrix and e is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it¬†‚Ä¶

In many important statistical applications, the number of variables or parameters p is much larger than the number of observations n. Suppose then that we have observations y= XŒ≤+ z, where Œ≤‚àà R p is a parameter vector of interest, X is a data matrix with possibly far fewer¬†‚Ä¶

We prove an abstract Strichartz estimate, which implies previously unknown endpoint Strichartz estimates for the wave equation (in dimension n‚â• 4) and the Schr√∂dinger equation (in dimension n‚â• 3). Three other applications are discussed: local existence for a¬†‚Ä¶

This paper is concerned with the problem of recovering an unknown matrix from a small fraction of its entries. This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions¬†‚Ä¶

Additive combinatorics is the theory of counting additive structures in sets. This theory has seen exciting developments and dramatic changes in direction in recent years thanks to its connections with areas such as number theory, ergodic theory and graph theory. This¬†‚Ä¶

Among nonlinear PDEs, dispersive and wave equations form an important class of equations. These include the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the nonlinear wave equation, the Korteweg de Vries equation, and the wave maps equation. This book is an introduction¬†‚Ä¶

We prove that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes. There are three major ingredients. The first is Szemer√©di's theorem, which asserts that any subset of the integers of positive density contains progressions of arbitrary length. The second, which is¬†‚Ä¶

The field of random matrix theory has seen an explosion of activity in recent years, with connections to many areas of mathematics and physics. However, this makes the current state of the field almost too large to survey in a single book. In this graduate text, we focus on¬†‚Ä¶

Let A be a subset of a finite field F:= Z/q Z for some prime q. If| F|^ Œ¥<| A|<| F|^ 1-Œ¥ for some Œ¥> 0, then we prove the estimate| A+ A|+| A ‚ãÖ A| ‚âß c (Œ¥)| A|^ 1+ Œµ for some Œµ= Œµ (Œ¥)> 0.

We obtain global well-posedness, scattering, and global L_t,x^10 spacetime bounds for energy-class solutions to the quintic defocusing Schr√∂dinger equation in R^1+3, which is energy-critical. In particular, this establishes global existence of classical solutions. Our work¬†‚Ä¶

In this paper, we consider the universality of the local eigenvalue statistics of random matrices. Our main result shows that these statistics are determined by the first four moments of the distribution of the entries. As a consequence, we derive the universality of eigenvalue¬†‚Ä¶
